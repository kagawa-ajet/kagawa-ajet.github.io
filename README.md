# Kagawa AJET

This is a website for everyone, to learn about events, and other things going on
around kagawa.

There are already Several websites for Kagawa AJET;

- [Tumblr](https://ajetkagawa.tumblr.com/)
- [Weebly page](https://kagawaajet.weebly.com/)
- [Wikidot](http://kagawa.wikidot.com/)

Each of them with a different focus. Originally we had tried to consolidate the
information from these pages into one website. This however was not necessary,
as more than 90% of the traffic to this site was to the calendar, immediately
after we had posted an event. 

In an attempt to clear unused clutter from the page, we have decided to replace
it with this page - just a calendar, with links to elsewhere should the user
need other information.
